How to run it.

Install XCode v7.1
Double click 'PrimeMultTable.xcodeproj'
From the Product menu select 'Test' to run all XCTests
From the Product menu select 'Run' to test the final application.

What i'm pleased with

Caught the irregular sized IntTable bug.

What I would do with more time

I would convert the PrimeSequence into a type Generator.
Better tests for the prime sequence.
I would look at creating a sieve for the prime sequence.
I would wrap up the final rush of code in main.swift into a class and create test for all possible inputs.
I would create an interface for IntTableRenderer 
I would make IntTable a generic as there is no need to fix it to basic Integers
